# American-CS-Survery


#### -- Project Status: [Active, 75% Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is ti create more awareness to active free data that offers data analyst or analyst to be able to uncover insights. In this project I describe a quick 3 step process from data cleaning(SQL), modifying data to create new metrics(Google BigQuery), and Tableau to highlight some insights from the data. 

### About the data
The American Community Survey (ACS) is an annual survey that collects detailed demographic, social, and economic data from over 3.5 million households in the U.S., providing insights for strategic decision-making and allocating over $675 billion in federal and state funding. Businesses, planners, and public officials use this data to understand community needs, identify workforce trends, and make informed decisions about development and investment. The ACS covers topics like jobs, education, housing, and veteran status, offering a comprehensive view of the nationâ€™s people and communities.
